# Final Project – A Text Analysis of UNGA Speeches, U.S. Foreign Policy Themes (2024-2025) and Public Sentiment on Trump’s UNGA 2025 Address
# **Abstract**
This project looks at how US diplomatic relations at the UNGA changed from the latter part of 2024 to the entire year 2025. This time frame depicts the political change that altered expectations for U.S.-UN engagement from the late Biden administration to President Trump's inauguration in January 2025 till the year end. The study uses TF-IDF, LDA topic modeling, and text preprocessing on a corpus of official UNGA speech transcripts to find themes in institutional discourse in the United States.


The analysis reveals a significant structural shift: although U.S. officials made many statements in late 2024, the number of official speeches in 2025 drastically decreased, indicating either a diminished diplomatic presence or changing priorities under the Trump administration. In line with conventional UN discourse, UNGA themes continue to be focused on global governance, humanitarian concerns, and multilateral cooperation throughout the combined corpus.


The project uses the YouTube Data API to analyze YouTube comments on Trump's 2025 UNGA speech in order to add public digital reactions to the institutional record. Although sentiment scores vary greatly among videos, they typically cluster close to neutral, suggesting that public reactions are fragmented rather than consistently polarized. When taken as a whole, these results show that official diplomatic messaging and online public responses function concurrently rather than in opposition to one another, emphasizing institutional discourse continuity and diffuse, generally moderate public engagement during this political transition.
